The goal of Algocet is to solve coding challenges. 
<br>It will do this by converting a declarative problem description into imperative C# code.  

This is a .NET Core 2.1 application using syntax trees and the Roslyn compiler. 

<h2>Overview</h2>

There are three main sub-projects:

 - <b>Algocet:</b> Generates a solution in the form of a CSharpSyntaxTree for a given problem.
 - <b>AlgocetConsole:</b> A CLI that takes a problem statement and saves the C# solution to a text file.
 - <b>CodingChallenges:</b> A test project to verify that Algocet is producing the correct solutions.
 
 Each problem statement is composed of <b>functions</b> and optional <b>constraints</b>.
